/*
Binary Converter


The binary numeric system uses only two digits: 0 and 1. Computers operate in binary, meaning they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones.

You need to make a program to convert integer numbers to their binary representation.
Create a Converter class with a static toBinary() method, which returns the binary version of its argument.
The code in main takes a number as input and calls the corresponding static method. Make sure the code works as expected.

Sample Input:
42
Sample Output:
101010

        System.out.print(Converter.toBinary(x));

public class Converter {
    static String toBinary(int arg) {
            String ans = "0";
            ans = Integer.toBinaryString(arg);
            return ans;
